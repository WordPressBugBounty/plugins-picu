### Why Photographers Choose picu for their Client Approval Workflow ###

picu is not just another plugin. It’s a whole new way of enabling clients to view and approve photos online. Free yourself up from endless admin, speed up project turnaround times, and delight your clients with an easy way to view, approve, and share feedback with you. 

Let’s take a closer look at exactly how picu can help you with your photography business: 

**Effortless Client Approval**

It’s time to say goodbye to endless back-and-forth emails and switch to an approval workflow that makes it easy for both you and your clients. With picu, you can share a link to photo galleries directly on your own website (not some third-party service) and make it effortless for your clients to browse and confirm their selections – as well as leave comments as they do so.

**Seamless Workflow**

The approval process with picu is as easy as it gets. As soon as you’ve created your gallery, simply send an automated email to your clients or manually copy the link to share with them separately. This link will allow them to view their photos and make their selections. Once they approve a collection, you’ll receive an automatic email notification, so you’re always in the loop without the hassle of chasing clients up. 

**Integration with Your Workflow**

picu seamlessly integrates with your existing photo management software. After your client approves a collection, you can easily retrieve their selections and incorporate them into your preferred workflow. Everything happens within the familiar environment of your WordPress website, making for a seamless photo proofing experience.

**Stunning, Theme-Independent Design**

picu prides itself on its beautiful, theme-independent design for proofing collections. This ensures a consistent, user-friendly, and easy-to-understand workflow for your clients. But that's not all – picu Pro takes it a step further by allowing you to customize the client photo gallery to match your branding, providing your clients with a personalized proofing experience that reinforces your professional image.

**Enhance Your Brand (Pro Only)**

With picu Pro, you have the power to add your custom logo and tailor the appearance of your galleries to align with *your unique branding*. This level of customization distinguishes you from the competition, and leaves a lasting impression on your clients. 

Set yourself apart from those photographers still using Dropbox or Google Drive, sending people away from their own website and relying on manual back & forth to keep track of every collection they’re waiting for approval on. 

**Interactive Image Feedback (Pro Only)**

picu Pro introduces the ability for your clients to *provide feedback by adding comments and markers* to individual images. This really helps make the communication meaningful, since all comments are directly attached to the images they relate to, rather than being included in separate emails or messages. Easily understand client preferences and requirements accurately, including which images they are referring to, every time.

**Flexible Selection Options (Pro Only)**

Want to specify the minimum or maximum number of images your client can select? No problem. With picu, you can use the *selection options* feature to define the number or range of images clients can approve, adding clarity to the approval process, and ensuring your clients meet their selection quotas every time.

**Download Capability (Pro Only)**

You can (optionally) allow clients to download all images in a convenient .zip file using the *download* feature. This feature is often popular with clients as it makes it easy for them to access and share the approved images with others. This is an optional feature you can enable for each gallery/client if you choose to use it.

**Efficient Image Management (Pro Only)**

Streamline image management with the *import* feature. Easily upload large quantities of images via FTP and import them to picu directly from your web server. This completely removes the need for time-consuming manual uploads, making your workflow more efficient.

**Theft Protection (Pro Only)**

Protect your valuable images from theft with picu Pro's *robust theft protection* measures. These measures include the ability to add watermarks to your uploads, along with other security features to ensure that your work remains secure.

**Multi-Client Support (Pro Only)**

picu Pro's *multi-client support* is ideal for photographers who manage multiple clients. Send photo collections to multiple recipients and receive individual selections, ensuring a seamless and organized workflow.

**Priority Support (Pro Only)**

At picu, we value our customers, and we're committed to providing exceptional support. picu Pro offers *priority support via email* exclusively to Pro license holders. When you need assistance, you can count on prompt and personalized support to address your specific needs.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `picu` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. Activate the "picu" plugin in the WordPress administration interface.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have a problem. Where can I get help? =
Please take a look at our [documentation](https://picu.io/docs/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme) first. 
Still having issues? Check out the [support forum here on wp.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/picu/) or reach out via our [support page](https://picu.io/support/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme).

= Emails are not working =

**Can WordPress send emails?**

picu uses functions built into WordPress to send emails. If you have any email issues, please make sure your WordPress installation can send emails, e.g., notifications for new comments, resetting passwords, etc. If those don’t work, picu won’t be able to send emails either.

**Receiving a notification once the client has approved a collection**

An email will be sent to you, announcing that the client has approved a collection. This email will be sent to the email address specified in your user profile. In the WordPress Admin go to “Users > Your Profile” to see/change that address. Make sure it is correct and working, otherwise you won’t receive any notifications!

**Changing the FROM name and address**

In case picu emails end up in the client’s SPAM folder, ask them to add your  FROM address (no-reply@ + your domain name) to their allow list. You might also use the email options to change the FROM name and address. There are also [ filters](https://picu.io/docs/developers/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme#custom-from-name) to do this.

= When viewing a collection I get a “page not found” / 404 error =

In your WordPress Admin, go to “Settings > Permalinks”. There is no need to “Save Changes”, just visiting the page will *flush the rewrite rules* so that any changes to the permalink structure will take effect. Sometimes this needs to be done manually, e.g., after changing the language of your website or after a new plugin was activated that introduced new permalinks.

= I don’t see any images when viewing my collection =

In 90% of cases this issue stems from using some kind of *optimization* or caching plugin. Please make sure to exclude picu collections from any kind of optimization or caching in the respective plugin’s settings.

= picu images show up in the Media Library =

By default, we hide all images in the Media Library. Sometimes, third party plugins *tamper* with the way image uploads are connected to their parent post. If that connection between image and collection is lost, picu can’t filter its images from appearing in the library.

= picu images do not show up in the Media Library =

This is intentional. 🙂 We wanted to separate the images that you use in a picu collection from the images you use on your website, thereby keeping you from accidentally using an image from a collection in a blog post or in your portfolio.
The media library would get completely crammed and confusing having hundreds, or in some cases thousands, of (temporary) images in there.

picu also cleans up behind itself: When you delete a collection, all images are deleted from the server automatically. (You can see how using an image elsewhere on the site would become a problem here.)

= More options are available via filters and action hooks =

There are lots of additional options to configure and extend picu by using a little bit of code. To get started, have a look at our [developers page](https://picu.io/docs/developers/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme). Also, please have a look at our examples page with lots of [working code snippets](https://picu.io/docs/developers/filter-examples/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme).

= Can I help translate picu into my language? =

Yes! picu has been translated by our kind users into many different languages. If not available already, you can contribute translations by going to [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/picu/). Choose your language, then click on "Stable (latest release)" and start adding translations. (Please note that you need a WordPress.org account to add translations.)

BTW: We are looking for people to help us [translate our Pro modules as well](https://picu.io/docs/translating-picu/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme). If you are interested in a free license, [get in touch](mailto:info@picu.io).

= I have an idea that would make picu even better =

Awesome! We are always open to feature suggestions and are always interested to learn about photographers' workflows. Please [get in touch](mailto:info@picu.io)!
